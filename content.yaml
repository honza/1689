        "The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of all
        saving knowledge, faith, and obedience, although the light of nature, and the
        works of creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and
        power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give
        that knowledge of God and his will which is necessary unto salvation. Therefore
        it pleased the Lord at sundry times and in divers manners to reveal himself, and
        to declare that his will unto his church; and afterward for the better
        preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and
        comfort of the church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of
        Satan, and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing; which maketh
        the Holy Scriptures to be most necessary, those former ways of God's revealing
        his will unto his people being now ceased."

        The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration,
        are no part of the canon or rule of the Scripture, and, therefore, are
        of no authority to the church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved
        or made use of than other human writings.

        The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed,
        dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God (who
        is truth itself), the author thereof; therefore it is to be received because it
        is the Word of God.

        high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scriptures; and the heavenliness of
        the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, and the majesty of the style,
        the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is to give
        all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way of man's
        salvation, and many other incomparable excellencies, and entire
        perfections thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence
        itself to be the Word of God; yet notwithstanding, our full persuasion
        and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority thereof, is

        Word in our hearts."

        necessarily contained in the Holy Scripture: unto which nothing at any
        time is to be added, whether by new revelation of the Spirit, or
        traditions of men. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward illumination
        of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving understanding of
        such things as are revealed in the Word, and that there are some
        circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government of the
        church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be ordered
        by the light of nature and Christian prudence, according to the general
        rules of the Word, which are always to be observed."

        The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people
        of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the
        writing of it was most generally known to the nations), being
        immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence
        kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentic; so as in all
        controversies of religion, the church is finally to appeal to them. But
        because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God,
        who have a right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded
        in the fear of God to read and search them, therefore they are to be
        translated into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they
        come, that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship
        him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the
        Scriptures may have hope.

        The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture
        itself; and therefore when there is a question about the true and full

        searched by other places that speak more clearly.

          ends; yet so, as the sinfulness of their acts proceedeth only from the
          creatures, and not from God, who, being most holy and righteous,
          neither is nor can be the author or approver of sin.  ( Romans

          The most wise, righteous, and gracious God doth oftentimes leave for a
          season his own children to manifold temptations and the corruptions of
          their own hearts, to chastise them for their former sins, or to
          discover unto them the hidden strength of corruption and deceitfulness
          of their hearts, that they may be humbled; and to raise them to a more
          close and constant dependence for their support upon himself; and to
          make them more watchful against all future occasions of sin, and for
          other just and holy ends. So that whatsoever befalls any of his elect
          is by his appointment, for his glory, and their good.  ( 2 Chronicles
          32:25, 26, 31; 2 Corinthians 12:7-9; Romans 8:28 )

          As for those wicked and ungodly men whom God, as the righteous judge,
          for former sin doth blind and harden; from them he not only
          withholdeth his grace, whereby they might have been enlightened in
          their understanding, and wrought upon their hearts; but sometimes also
          withdraweth the gifts which they had, and exposeth them to such
          objects as their corruption makes occasion of sin; and withal, gives
          them over to their own lusts, the temptations of the world, and the
          power of Satan, whereby it comes to pass that they harden themselves,
          under those means which God useth for the softening of others.  (
