        "The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of all
        saving knowledge, faith, and obedience, although the light of nature, and the
        works of creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and
        power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give
        that knowledge of God and his will which is necessary unto salvation. Therefore
        it pleased the Lord at sundry times and in divers manners to reveal himself, and
        to declare that his will unto his church; and afterward for the better
        preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and
        comfort of the church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of
        Satan, and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing; which maketh
        the Holy Scriptures to be most necessary, those former ways of God's revealing
        his will unto his people being now ceased."

        The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration,
        are no part of the canon or rule of the Scripture, and, therefore, are
        of no authority to the church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved
        or made use of than other human writings.

        The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed,
        dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God (who
        is truth itself), the author thereof; therefore it is to be received because it
        is the Word of God.

        the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, and the majesty of the style,
        the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is to give
        all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way of man's
        salvation, and many other incomparable excellencies, and entire
        perfections thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence
        itself to be the Word of God; yet notwithstanding, our full persuasion
        and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority thereof, is
        from the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the
        Word in our hearts."

        necessarily contained in the Holy Scripture: unto which nothing at any
        time is to be added, whether by new revelation of the Spirit, or
        traditions of men. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward illumination
        of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving understanding of
        such things as are revealed in the Word, and that there are some
        circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government of the
        church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be ordered
        by the light of nature and Christian prudence, according to the general
        rules of the Word, which are always to be observed."

        The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people
        of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the
        writing of it was most generally known to the nations), being
        immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence
        kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentic; so as in all
        controversies of religion, the church is finally to appeal to them. But
        because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God,
        who have a right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded
        in the fear of God to read and search them, therefore they are to be
        translated into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they
        come, that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship
        him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the
        Scriptures may have hope.

        The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture
        itself; and therefore when there is a question about the true and full

        searched by other places that speak more clearly.

          God hath endued the will of man with that natural liberty and power of
          acting upon choice, that it is neither forced, nor by any necessity of
          nature determined to do good or evil.

          Man, in his state of innocency, had freedom and power to will and to
          do that which was good and wellpleasing to God, but yet was unstable,
          so that he might fall from it.

          Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of
          will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation; so as a natural
          man, being altogether averse from that good, and dead in sin, is not
          able by his own strength to convert himself, or to prepare himself
          thereunto.

          When God converts a sinner, and translates him into the state of
          grace, he freeth him from his natural bondage under sin, and by his
          grace alone enables him freely to will and to do that which is
          spiritually good; yet so as that by reason of his remaining
          corruptions, he doth not perfectly, nor only will, that which is good,
          but doth also will that which is evil.

          This will of man is made perfectly and immutably free to good alone in
          the state of glory only.

          Those whom God hath predestinated unto life, he is pleased in his
          appointed, and accepted time, effectually to call, by his Word and
          Spirit, out of that state of sin and death in which they are by
          nature, to grace and salvation by Jesus Christ; enlightening their
          minds spiritually and savingly to understand the things of God; taking
          away their heart of stone, and giving unto them a heart of flesh;
          renewing their wills, and by his almighty power determining them to
          that which is good, and effectually drawing them to Jesus Christ; yet
          so as they come most freely, being made willing by his grace.

          "This effectual call is of God's free and special grace alone, not
          from anything at all foreseen in man, nor from any power or agency in
          the creature, being wholly passive therein, being dead in sins and
          trespasses, until being quickened and renewed by the Holy Spirit; he
          is thereby enabled to answer this call, and to embrace the grace
          offered and conveyed in it, and that by no less power than that which
          raised up Christ from the dead."

          Elect infants dying in infancy are regenerated and saved by Christ
          through the Spirit; who worketh when, and where, and how he pleases;
          so also are all elect persons, who are incapable of being outwardly
          called by the ministry of the Word.

          "Others not elected, although they may be called by the ministry of the
          Word, and may have some common operations of the Spirit, yet not being
          effectually drawn by the Father, they neither will nor can truly come
          to Christ, and therefore cannot be saved: much less can men that
          receive not the Christian religion be saved; be they never so diligent
          to frame their lives according to the light of nature and the law of
          that religion they do profess."
