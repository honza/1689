        "The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of all
        saving knowledge, faith, and obedience, although the light of nature, and the
        works of creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and
        power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give
        that knowledge of God and his will which is necessary unto salvation. Therefore
        it pleased the Lord at sundry times and in divers manners to reveal himself, and
        to declare that his will unto his church; and afterward for the better
        preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and
        comfort of the church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of
        Satan, and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing; which maketh
        the Holy Scriptures to be most necessary, those former ways of God's revealing
        his will unto his people being now ceased."

        The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration,
        are no part of the canon or rule of the Scripture, and, therefore, are
        of no authority to the church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved
        or made use of than other human writings.

        The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed,
        dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God (who
        is truth itself), the author thereof; therefore it is to be received because it
        is the Word of God.

        the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, and the majesty of the style,
        the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is to give
        all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way of man's
        salvation, and many other incomparable excellencies, and entire
        perfections thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence
        itself to be the Word of God; yet notwithstanding, our full persuasion
        and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority thereof, is
        from the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the
        Word in our hearts."

        necessarily contained in the Holy Scripture: unto which nothing at any
        time is to be added, whether by new revelation of the Spirit, or
        traditions of men. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward illumination
        of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving understanding of
        such things as are revealed in the Word, and that there are some
        circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government of the
        church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be ordered
        by the light of nature and Christian prudence, according to the general
        rules of the Word, which are always to be observed."

        The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people
        of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the
        writing of it was most generally known to the nations), being
        immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence
        kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentic; so as in all
        controversies of religion, the church is finally to appeal to them. But
        because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God,
        who have a right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded
        in the fear of God to read and search them, therefore they are to be
        translated into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they
        come, that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship
        him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the
        Scriptures may have hope.

        The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture
        itself; and therefore when there is a question about the true and full

        searched by other places that speak more clearly.

          Although the gospel be the only outward means of revealing Christ and
          saving grace, and is, as such, abundantly sufficient thereunto; yet
          that men who are dead in trespasses may be born again, quickened or
          regenerated, there is moreover necessary an effectual insuperable work
          of the Holy Spirit upon the whole soul, for the producing in them a
          new spiritual life; without which no other means will effect their
          conversion unto God.

          "The liberty which Christ hath purchased for believers under the
          gospel, consists in their freedom from the guilt of sin, the
          condemning wrath of God, the rigour and curse of the law, and in their
          being delivered from this present evil world, bondage to Satan, and
          dominion of sin, from the evil of afflictions, the fear and sting of
          death, the victory of the grave, and ever- lasting damnation: as also
          in their free access to God, and their yielding obedience unto Him,
          not out of slavish fear, but a child-like love and willing mind.  All
          which were common also to believers under the law for the substance of
          them; but under the New Testament the liberty of Christians is further
          enlarged, in their freedom from the yoke of a ceremonial law, to which
          the Jewish church was subjected, and in greater boldness of access to
          the throne of grace, and in fuller communications of the free Spirit
          of God, than believers under the law did ordinarily partake of."

          God alone is Lord of the conscience, and hath left it free from the
          doctrines and commandments of men which are in any thing contrary to
          his word, or not contained in it. So that to believe such doctrines,
          or obey such commands out of conscience, is to betray true liberty of
          conscience; and the requiring of an implicit faith, an absolute and
          blind obedience, is to destroy liberty of conscience and reason also.

          They who upon pretence of Christian liberty do practice any sin, or
          cherish any sinful lust, as they do thereby pervert the main design of
          the grace of the gospel to their own destruction, so they wholly
          destroy the end of Christian liberty, which is, that being delivered
          out of the hands of all our enemies, we might serve the Lord without
          fear, in holiness and righeousness before Him, all the days of our
          lives.

          The light of nature shews that there is a God, who hath lordship and
          sovereignty over all; is just, good and doth good unto all; and is
          therefore to be feared, loved, praised, called upon, trusted in, and
          served, with all the heart and all the soul, and with all the
          might. But the acceptable way of worshipping the true God, is
          instituted by himself, and so limited by his own revealed will, that
          he may not be worshipped according to the imagination and devices of
          men, nor the suggestions of Satan, under any visible representations,
          or any other way not prescribed in the Holy Scriptures.

          in the name of the Son, by the help of the Spirit, according to his
          will; with understanding, reverence, humility, fervency, faith, love,
          and perseverance; and when with others, in a known tongue.

          worshipped everywhere in spirit and in truth; as in private families
          daily, and in secret each one by himself; so more solemnly in the
          public assemblies, which are not carelessly nor wilfully to be
